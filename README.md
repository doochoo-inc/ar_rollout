# ArRollout

ArRollout is the ActiveRecord version of (Rollout)[https://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout], written
after the wonderful Railscast (315-rollout-and-degrade)[http://railscasts.com/episodes/315-rollout-and-degrade]
by Ryan Bates (thank you).


This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

## ToDo

- Write `activate_group` and `deactivate_group`
- The same for the user
- Activate a feature for all users
